    "Bio": "A few years ago, I was driving alone on the highway at cruising speed. The road was straight and the sun was hot, and the moment felt right to sing my heart out. Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, \u201cDoes he think the car is soundproof?\u201d We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.\n\nThere has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it\u2019s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they\u2019re already looking at you it\u2019ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that\u2019s the moral.",

    "Bio": "Have you ever asked AI to generate an image of a really really good-looking teenage Taiwanese male UC Berkeley student who is also in acappella? Well if you have, then you don't need to read the rest of my bio, because the image you saw was indeed an image of me. Now some of you might argue that there are actually no good-looking individuals on the campus of this school, and every student just has so-called \"Berkeley Goggles\". I would agree with you... if I didn't look in the mirror every morning. And hey, since you already bothered to come all the way to this website, scroll down to find the most fit-looking young man on this page, and begin reading this bio, I thought I would share a special treat with you. I have decided to finally publish my highly curated highly personalized day-to-day routines to live by in order to look almost as good as me.\n\n1. Be Taiwanese. I recommend looking into RCTA if necessary.\n2. Dye your hair. It doesn't have to be the ones on your head.\n3. Spend at least 4 hours a day with Ellington. Doing what? That I won't share.",
