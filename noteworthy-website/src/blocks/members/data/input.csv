The road was straight and the sun was hot, and the moment felt right to sing my heart out. Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, “Does he think the car is soundproof?” We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.

There has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it’s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they’re already looking at you it’ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that’s the moral.", ,"Yes, You know I want you."

And hey, since you already bothered to come all the way to this website, scroll down to find the most fit-looking young man on this page, and begin reading this bio, I thought I would share a special treat with you. I have decided to finally publish my highly curated highly personalized day-to-day routines to live by in order to look almost as good as me.

1. Be Taiwanese. I recommend looking into RCTA if necessary.
2. Dye your hair. It doesn't have to be the ones on your head.
3. Spend at least 4 hours a day with Ellington. Doing what? That I won't share.","I was writing this bio and looked up some examples and they were so funny they got me dead 2 3 4.

While some whisper of world domination, others suspect a more nefarious plot involving...birds? Is Kian a misunderstood environmentalist or a cunning avian overlord? Only time will tell!

In his free time, Kian enjoys a variety of musical genres, including kpop and edm. When not plotting (or protecting the skies from feathered robotic fiends), you can find Kian at the gym, playing cookie run, hanging out with his girlfriend, calling his girlfriend, or sleeping. One thing is certain: Kian's presence guarantees an element of the unexpected, so keep your eyes peeled and your tinfoil hats handy!

Noteworthy Achievements:

- Successfully infiltrated Noteworthy for two semesters without revealing his true identity
- Maintains an astounding record of mega bopping during vocal rehearsals (or is he using some sort of mind control device?)
- Ranked highest for ""bird"" government tracking chips collected
- Has a low spice tolerance despite having a name pronounced like a pepper

Questions Kian Would Like Answered:

- Are birds real?
- Do I have Alzheimer's?

- Do I have Alzheimer's?
